## Data Sources

This server uses three open Swiss cultural heritage APIs — all without authentication:

| Source | Documentation |
|--------|--------------|
| SIK-ISEA | [www.sik-isea.ch](https://www.sik-isea.ch/) |
| Nationalmuseum (SNM) | [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss/) |
| Nationalbibliothek (Helveticat) | OAI-PMH endpoint |

When adding new data sources, follow the **No-Auth-First** principle: Phase 1 uses only open, authentication-free endpoints. Authenticated APIs are introduced in later phases with graceful degradation.
